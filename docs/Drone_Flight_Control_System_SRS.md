# Drone Flight Control System (DFCS)
## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**Document ID:** DFCS-SRS-001  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Baseline for POC development  
**Date:** 2026-11-02

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the requirements for a proof-of-concept (POC) custom quadcopter flight-control system. The project is intended to demonstrate an end-to-end software development lifecycle (SDLC), including requirements analysis, architecture and detailed design, implementation, verification, test automation, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), simulation, and controlled hardware validation.

This is an engineering POC. It is **not an aviation-certified, production-ready, or inherently safe flight-control system**. No requirement in this document constitutes authorization to fly.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Objective

Develop custom flight-control firmware for a Quad-X multirotor using an STM32H743-based development board. Implement and verify the portable flight-control logic in simulation before integrating it with physical sensors and actuator interfaces.

### 2.2 Project goals

- Develop a modular embedded firmware architecture.
- Implement sensor acquisition, state estimation, flight-state management, attitude control, and motor mixing.
- Establish a simulation-first development and verification workflow.
- Automate unit, integration, static-analysis, build, and simulation tests.
- Establish traceability from requirements through design and tests.
- Demonstrate a reproducible CI pipeline and versioned firmware artifacts.
- Validate hardware interfaces on a bench with propulsion disabled.

### 2.3 Out of scope

The following are excluded from the initial POC:

- Autonomous waypoint missions.
- Obstacle detection or avoidance.
- Computer vision or AI-based navigation.
- Swarm or multi-drone coordination.
- Beyond-visual-line-of-sight operation.
- Payload delivery.
- Commercial or production deployment.
- Aviation certification or claims of compliance with a safety standard.
- Unsupervised or public flight testing.

## 3. Scope and Assumptions

### 3.1 In scope

1. Custom firmware for STM32H743.
2. FreeRTOS-based task scheduling.
3. Hardware abstraction and sensor-driver interfaces.
4. IMU acquisition and attitude estimation.
5. Basic attitude stabilization using configurable PID control.
6. Quad-X motor mixing and output limiting.
7. Flight-state and arming-state management.
8. Basic telemetry and command handling using MAVLink 2.
9. Software-in-the-loop (SITL) integration with Gazebo through a custom bridge.
10. Host-based unit and integration testing.
11. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) groundwork and bench validation.
12. Git-based source control and GitHub Actions CI.

### 3.2 Assumptions

- The initial airframe model is a four-motor Quad-X configuration.
- The selected development board is the STM32 NUCLEO-H743ZI2, subject to procurement and board-revision verification.
- The MCU is from the STM32H743 family and uses an ARM Cortex-M7 core.
- The portable control and estimation code will be buildable on a desktop host.
- Gazebo Harmonic will provide the simulated vehicle and environment.
- QGroundControl is the initial ground-station candidate; compatibility with the custom MAVLink message set must be verified.
- Sensor and ESC part numbers, electrical characteristics, pin mapping, and calibration parameters will be finalized during detailed design.
- Initial testing will use simulated actuators or electrically disconnected motor outputs. Physical propulsion is not part of initial acceptance.

## 4. System Context and Architecture

### 4.1 Logical architecture

The system consists of the following logical elements:

1. **Ground Control Station (GCS):** Displays telemetry and, where enabled, sends supported commands.
2. **Communication interface:** Receives and transmits MAVLink 2 messages.
3. **Flight application:** Manages flight states, arming conditions, and mode transitions.
4. **State estimation:** Processes sensor data to estimate vehicle attitude and other supported state values.
5. **Flight control:** Computes control demands from validated inputs and estimated state.
6. **Motor mixer:** Converts control demands into four bounded motor commands using the Quad-X geometry.
7. **Safety manager:** Enforces arming checks, output inhibition, fault handling, and failsafe transitions.
8. **Hardware abstraction layer (HAL):** Provides portable interfaces to MCU peripherals and device drivers.
9. **RTOS/platform layer:** Provides task scheduling, synchronization, timing, and hardware services.
10. **Simulation adapter:** Exchanges simulated sensor data and actuator commands with Gazebo.

### 4.2 Architecture principle

Flight-control, estimation, state-machine, and motor-mixing logic shall be independent of STM32-specific HAL calls and FreeRTOS APIs wherever practical. Hardware and simulation shall implement common interfaces so that the same portable application logic can be tested in both environments.

### 4.3 Proposed data flow

`Sensors / Simulator -> Sensor Drivers / Adapter -> Validation -> State Estimation -> Flight-State Manager and Controller -> Safety Output Gate -> Quad-X Mixer -> Actuator Interface / Simulator`

The safety output gate shall be able to inhibit actuator commands independently of the normal control calculation.

## 9. External Interface Requirements

### 9.1 Sensor interfaces

Detailed design shall specify the exact device, electrical levels, bus speed, sample rate, data format, calibration, timeout, and error behavior for each selected sensor.

## 10. Flight-State Model

The following is the initial logical state model. Detailed design shall define every permitted transition and its guards.

- Its implementation and interface are reviewed.
- Relevant unit and integration tests are present and passing.
- Static-analysis findings are resolved or formally dispositioned.
- Requirements-to-test traceability is updated.
- Relevant design and user documentation is updated.
- CI checks pass.
- Test evidence is retained.
- Safety impact and failure behavior have been reviewed where applicable.
